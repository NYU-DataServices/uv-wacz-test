# uv-wacz-test

Crawl live sites to produce WACZ files with local [browsertrix-crawler](https://crawler.docs.browsertrix.com/) via Docker. 

Results are stored here* under `/crawls/collections`  for demo/test use in UltraViolet as part of WebRecorder playback custom previewer development (WiP, 2025)

*on RW/locally; .gitignored due to size

## Prerequisites
- Git
- Docker

## Setup
- `docker pull webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler`

## Instructions


1. **CRAWL:** Run a crawl with the following command, replacing MY_URL and MY_ID with your values:
    ``` sh
    sh crawl.sh MY_URL MY_ID
    ```
    Once the crawl is finished, a WACZ file will be created in `./crawls/collection/test/MY_ID.wacz`

2. **QA:** Add the `.wacz` file to https://replayweb.page/ to preview it with WebRecorder Playback. (Note: These files do not persist and are *not* a substitute for deposit.)
